# Vector-Datbases
This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline using vector databases to enhance document parsing and semantic search. The system utilizes sentence transformers for embedding generation, Differnet Vector Database for vector indexing, and FLAN-T5-Small for response retrieval.

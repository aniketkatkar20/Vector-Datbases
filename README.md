# Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with Different Vector Databases

## Overview
This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline using vector databases to enhance document parsing and semantic search. The system utilizes sentence transformers for embedding generation, Faiss for vector indexing, and FLAN-T5-Small for response retrieval.

## Setup
1. Run the notebook in **Google Colab**.
2. Upload **PDF files(stabale.pdf)** as the dataset is attached.
3. Install dependencies: For Each RAG for different Vector Database Command is there above each RAG
